## Some comments on using git

* a ***git clone*** does not preserve original timestamps (which e.g. CVS does). See   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2179722/checking-out-old-file-with-original-create-modified-timestamps for some comments on this

* a ***git add*** of a directory tree convieniently adds the whole tree, so ***git commit** will then commit the whole tree.
